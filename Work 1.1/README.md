# Prevent Fork Bomb

This project was devided in two parts. 

Part 1 prevents a fork bomb, by setting a limit for the number of processes of a user and then running a fork bomb.

Part 2 creates a JSON file, "1.1_2.json", that works as the pstree for a given process. Also, it keeps showing the number of processes in the operating system and the number of processes by user every 10 seconds.
